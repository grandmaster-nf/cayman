## GM Guide: Weapons

Weapon choice in GM Ordeals comes down to seasonal champion mods, recently boosted archetypes (Hello Rockets), high burst damage and good sustain damage.

Weapon perks for GMs and endgame vary from your usual best in slot gun perks. Feeding Frenzy + Rampage may be your favorite perks for regular content, but they don’t work well in GMs because you won’t be killing adds rapidly to take advantage of reload and damage perks. Instead you want to run perks like Vorpal, Explosive payload, Disruption break, etc that synergise with endgame content and champion mods. Exotic primaries are less viable and often not worth using in GMs, but the DMT scout and the 3 exotic bows might change that this season.

## Primary
This weapon will vary every season due to the changing artifact mods. This season we have Anti-Barrier Scout Rifle, Unstoppable Hand Cannon and Pulse, and Overload Bow.

### Primary Weapon perks
The primary weapon perks you want for GMs are:

**Vorpal** - bonus 15% damage to bosses, champions, elites, and vehicles. Always active.

**Explosive payload** - delivers bonus AoE damage even with body shots and has no range drop off. Best perk for unstoppable and overload weapons since it lets you stun champs faster, and can stun multiple champs if they are close to each other. Explosive rounds can also stagger enemies and you can damage them behind cover by shooting near them.

**Disruption break** - breaking an elemental shield gives a 50% damage buff to your kinetic weapon for a short duration This is an amazing perk to run on primary energy weapons, and also procs on barrier champ shield breaks.

Reload perks that synergize for GMs - **overflow**, **rapid hit**, **auto loading holster**. **Full-auto** is also great (for scouts) if the base handling and reload is high.

**Armor Piercing Rounds** are great for anti-barrier weapons. Straight up bonus 5% damage to shielded adds. **High Caliber Rounds** would be the second best option.

Bow perks: **shorter Draw time**, **Archer’s Tempo/Rapid Hit**, **Explosive Head (must have)**.

### Exotic Primaries:

- **Dead Man’s Tale** - use with Anti-barrier champ mod and Sundering Glare (+20% damage)
- **Ticuu’s Divination** - very good for add clear and overload champs, can create warmind cells.
- **Le Monarque** - good for overload champions and void shields, poison reapplies the stun.
- **Trinity Ghoul** - good add clear but not the best for overload champs due to longer draw time.
- **Riskrunner** - very good for add clear against hive and fallen.

## Special
With the introduction of champion mods to special weapons with Beyond Light, it’s no longer required to run double primary loadouts for GMs. Your choice of special weapon will depend on the strike, champ types and team loadout.

Sniper rifles having anti-barrier and getting bonus damage from the mod make them the ideal special weapons to use for GMs that have barrier champs.

Vorpal is the best perk to have on snipers. A high-impact Anti-barrier sniper with vorpal will break a champion’s barrier with one precision shot. Reload perks like Triple tap,Clown cartridge and Fourth times the charm are also very useful.

A breach Grenade Launcher with blinding grenades is also very handy, but only one player should run it. Blinding grenades for GLs will let you stun multiple enemies. Also works on majors and elites, but not on champs or bosses. Auto-loading holster recommended.

Exotics like Divinity, Eriana’s Vow and Izanagi are ideal for GMs and will pair nicely with high-burst heavy weapons like Rocket launchers.

Players should use special ammo finisher mod on class items to make ammo on demand. Ammo reserves are easier to maintain with special ammo finder mods, Aeon gloves and special ammo reserve mods.

### Exotic specials:

- **Eriana’s Vow** - excellent for barrier champs, but with snipers having AB this season, it’s not required and will free up the exotic slot for heavy weapons. Can be obtained from the exotic kiosk in the tower, catalyst adds auto-loading holster and bigger reserves. It’s a hand cannon that uses special ammo but shoots like a sniper, and works with hand cannon mods (except ammo finder).
- **Divinity** - best overload weapon for champions and also applies a damage debuff (35% but does not stack with tether debuff). Good synergy for Rocket launchers with Lasting Impression and excellent when paired with snipers like Izanagi for burst damage. Divinity creates a big crit spot on any enemy/boss, letting you snipe them with ease. Sundering Glare artifact mod stacks with it for additional 20% damage.
- **Izanagi’s Burden** - high burst sniper, especially when combined with Divinity (no need to aim). Can use the Anti-barrier mod this season, and should be paired with rocket launchers or machine guns. Honed Edge 4x delivers a lot of damage and can delete champions from range. Can be purchased from the exotic kiosk in the tower, catalyst adds bonus damage.


## Heavy
A slot usually reserved for exotics that can deal high burst or sustain damage, depending on the ordeal. The buff to Rocket launchers however makes them viable and accessible for GMs, freeing up the exotic slot for special or primary weapons.

- **Anarchy** - the most common GM heavy weapon, and rightfully so. Good sustain damage, can spawn trap adds, and has very good ammo economy. Attach 2 grenades to a boss, take cover and watch its health bar tick down. For champions you want to attach only one nade, and the other near the floor. Barrier champs who summon the shield will despawn the anarchy grande attached to them, so it’s optimal to stick one grenade on the body and second on the floor near them, which will keep on damaging them after the shield break. Using anarchy to kill adds and swapping to a warmind weapon will also let you create warmind cells!
- **Xenophage** - top tier heavy weapon for both fast add clear and champion burst damage. Can create warmind cells with Wrath of Rasputin mod. Ideal with a double primary loadout, you’ll get plenty of heavy ammo with machine gun scavenger and finder mods. Dual purpose for long range and close range encounters. Explosive rounds deliver the full damage even with body shots, so crits are not required, and the AoE can damage enemies behind cover.
- **Lament** - High burst close range damage dealer for aggressive players, and can break barrier champion shields. Combine with passive guard, and lucent blade for bonus damage. Lament is an Anti-barrier weapon and will not work with overload sword artifact mod.
- **Falling Guillotine** - Close range damage dealer for aggressive players. Combine with passive guard, lucent blade, and disrupting blade for overload champs.
- **Rocket Launchers** - High burst for champions, ranged damage for bosses and also very good add-clear. Ideal for double primary or long range loadouts.
  - **Exotics**:
    - **Two-tailed Fox** or **Wardcliff Coil** for burst,
    - **Deathbringer** or **Eyes of Tomorrow** for add-clear.
  - **Legendary RL**:
    - For add-clear, look for high blast radius perks, Chain Reaction, Field Prep or Ambitious Assassin.
    - For high burst damage, look for velocity perks, Impact Casing, Lasting Impression, Auto-loading Holster or Clown Cartridge. Precision frame RL’s have intrinsic tracking, making them better than other archetypes.
- **Legendary LMGs** - Suitable for ordeals with high add density and lots of shields. Can be combined with two special weapons and used as a primary add-clear weapon.
