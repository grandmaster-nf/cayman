### Devil’s Lair
Overload and Barrier champs. Fallen and Hive enemies. High add density and multiple waves. All types of shields. Arc Resistance, Concussive Dampener, Sniper resist.

**Class Composition:** Tether, Banner Shield, Well of Radiance, Revenant, Shadebinder, Chaos Reach.


**Team Weapon Loadout:** AB snipers, Overload bows, Anarchy, Xenophage, Rocket Launchers, Arc/Void LMG

#### Safe loadout for Devils Lair:
 
Hunter - Stasis with duskfield grenades, hedrons + torment + durance fragment.
Mobility and Discipline spec armor. Aeon exotic gloves with Sect of Insight mod. Resonance Siphon artifact mod.
 
Warlock - Well of radiance with Phoenix Protocol exotic chest. Recovery and Intellect spec armor. Two players can run this warlock setup with a banner titan.
 
Titan - Banner Shield with Ursa Furiosa exotic gloves. Resilience (60) and Intellect spec armor. Titan should be one of the Anarchy users.
 
Two players run Anarchy with elemental legendary bows - solar and arc, and Anti-barrier sniper. Third player runs an AB scout, LeMonarque exotic bow and a RL or LMG (arc or solar). Scout user should have Sundering Glare artifact mod.
 
Start of the Ordeal, hug the right side and run past most adds to the end with a servitor/captain. Clear adds and work on overload champion. Sparrow inside and clear hive, kill the barrier champion. Next room, clear hive and solar wizard on left side first, spawn kill the thrall from the left door, then work on the overload captain. Use Aeon finisher for ammo when safe to do so. Move up towards the right, while keeping cover on the left to avoid snipers. Clear barrier knight and then work on the fallen fighting the wizards. Take out the vandal snipers first, then solar wizards, arc knights and arc captains and finally kill the overload captain.
 
Jump up on the ledge where the vandals were sniping from, after activating the ghost scan. Use the left side with cover and banner shield super to block damage. Alternate banner and well of radiance to clear adds till the shank wave comes out, then kill the fallen champion and get ready for the second wave. Solar shielded wizards should be killed asap - break shields and spam stasis or grenades on adds. Barrier knight boomer attacks can kill with splash damage, so be careful. Final wave will bring more fallen and two overload captains. Melee vandals will teleport to your platform so use anarchy to trap them. Collect ammo after the room is clear and move to the next area. Overload captain and few adds on the way to the big area with the walker and brigs.
 
Immediately clear the fallen next to the barrier servitor, use a well. Snipe the vandal snipers on the right side from a distance, then clear the fallen in the building to the left. Moving forward will spawn the walker tank and two brigs, so try to clear as many sniper vandals as you can before. Use the central building for cover and clear the brigs one by one - safe way is to attach anarchy and take cover. Their aerial AoE attack has a big radius and can wipe the team. Jump on top of the central building and anarchy the tank, then snipe the legs. Taking out the walker will stop the fallen dropships from respawning and dropping in more adds. Three overload captains and two barrier servitors remain, take them out one by one by using cover and supers as required. Killing the tank earlier gives you ease of movement and no fear of getting wiped by laser targeting or splash damage. Once the door opens, another overload captain and some adds will come out, clear them and scavenge for ammo.
 
Move up to the boss arena and rush into the room to the left - that is your safe spot. Two overload captains can be stunned through the windows. Attach anarchy grenades on the boss till it goes immune (⅔ health). More adds will come rushing, trap with anarchy and kill them from the safety of the room while using banner shield and well(s) to keep alive. Monarque player should break the void servitors shielding the boss. Anarchy the boss till two more overload captains spawn, kill them similar to the previous champions. Watch out for exploding shanks and resilient vandals. There will be a couple of adds under the room, go down and kill them so you can use that spot to damage the boss till the next wave of void servitors come out. This is it, break the shields and attach anarchy on the boss till it dies.

### Arms Dealer
Barrier and Unstoppable champs. Void shields. Grounded. Arc Resist, Solar Resist, Concussive Dampener. Boss can be summoned early for extra damage while riding the elevator up - nuking the boss is recommended. Medium-Long range engagements. 

**Class Composition:** Tether, Chaos Reach(x2), Thundercrash(x2). Well and Banner if you don’t nuke boss. 

**Team Weapon Loadout:** AB sniper, Unstoppable HC, Anarchy, RLs, Xeno, Ticcu’s, Izanagi, Eriana’s Vow.

#### Safe loadout for Arms Dealer:

Hunter - Tether (bottom-tree) with Aeon Gloves, Frost-EE5 or Orpheus Rigs. Mobility and Discipline armor, 50+ resilience recommended.

Warlock - Chaos Reach with Geomag boots. 90+ Intellect armor, 50+ resilience recommended. Alternatively, Well of Radiance with Phoenix Protocol.

Titan - Thundercrash with Falling Star chest. High resilience and Intellect armor. Alternatively, Banner Shield with Ursa Furiosa gloves.

Arms Dealer is a repeated GM and the strategy involves nuking the boss to as low health as possible, if not outright killing him. The boss can be summoned early which allows us to damage him more than normal, so a combination of tether hunter and two chaos reach warlocks is ideal for range and burst. 

Hunter should run an AB scout with Sundering Glare artifact mod. Combine with an overload Exotic bow - Ticcu’s or LeMonarque. Even though this GM does not have any overload champs, overload mods debuff enemies and allow you to engage from range. RL for heavy. (Can also run DMT + void HC + RL). Deathbringer is also a good option.

Warlocks and Titans should use AB snipers with at least one person running an unstoppable Hand Cannon (explosive payload recommended) and Anarchy.

Grounded modifier is active so try not to jump while taking damage. The cabal will spam sticky nades so high resilience is recommended. If you get stuck with a nade, most likely you will get one shot by it. Solar resist and concussive dampener will allow you to tank fatal damage from snipers, grenades and incendiary champions. The void grenades left by psions on the floor are deadly.

From spawn, bait the unstoppable champion by shooting in the direction of the adds, stun and dispatch with anarchy and snipers. Be careful while using finishers on unstoppable cabal champs, they can blow and wipe the fireteam if a player is shooting the tank on their backs. Clear the minor ads (void shields) and split up to defeat the AB colossus. Initiate scan and head out the door. Keep towards the left side and either blow up the cabal thresher, or wait for it to go away. Take out the phalaxes and legionaries, and prioritize the psion snipers hiding behind the boxes. The next wave will drop and you will have to deal with an unstoppable champion. Once the room is clear, pick up the solar orb then drop it to despawn.

Drop down and spawn trap the cabal warbeats with anarchy, then dispatch the barrier champion on the ledge. Stay at range and let the scout player apply sundering glare wherever possible. The thresher on the right side can one shot so either take it out or let it fly away. Hunter should invis the team and everyone should go far right and bait the dogs away from the second barrier colossus. You can use the elevation to head glitch the champion and avoid his attacks. One player goes back to get the solar orb, but right before the dunk, place two anarchy traps on the spawn door to the right and the force field up ahead. Kill the unstoppable champion and other adds to proceed. 

After killing a few more cabal and coming out into the big open patrol area, head down to the left and sparrow under the large ship to the other side. From there you can safely jump up to the ramp and deal with the barrier champion, but watch out for two sniper psions. This way you can ignore all the fallen enemies and cabal threshers. Sparrow through to the area with the two tanks. Stay at the entrance and split up - the tank can wipe out the fireteam if you’re bunched up. Snipe the 4 legs off the tank and use chaos reach. Kill the adds that don’t run away and move inside to the right, where the first elevator button is, and activate it. Use that area to take out the remaining adds(void shields) from range, and the unstoppable champion. 

There are two barrier champions up top - good idea for one player to go far right and jump up near the second elevator button to flank them. Once both champs are dead, activate the button and get ready to place anarchy traps on the bridge and the tank. Use tether and chaos reach to damage the tank then back away once the three unstoppable champions start rushing forward. Safely keep on backing away and repeat the stun + damage combo till the champs are dead, then finish off the tank. Snipe the elite centurion and clear the warbeasts to proceed to the final room before the boss fight. Scan and open the door.

Stay on the lower level and clear the flame turrets while watching out for the unstoppable champion, who can rush you. Clear the adds and two phalanxes then jump up where you destroyed the turrets. Clear the second wave of turrets and use cover to kill the remaining adds before engaging the two barrier champs. Best to split up and use snipers at range to deal with them. Once the room is clear, head to the elevator but DO NOT activate the button. One player should jump up on the elevator chains and reach the top of the chain - this makes the boss come out earlier than usual and you can damage him as you’re riding the elevator up. Activate the button once the jumper is on top and kill the cabal that dropped from the pod. The jumper should have rejoined the rest of the team before killing the last add. Boss will be standing on the ledge and you can tag him with anarchy and snipe him as you’re going up. His sniper shot can be fatal so try not to get hit by it. When you’re about to reach the top, reapply anarchy and back away, then use tether + both chaos reach to burst him down. If the boss does not die, back away and shoot him as he’s trying to get to the top of the pillar. If he’s under a third of his health bar, he will jump back down and you can finish him off without having to deal with any adds.

If you’re not running the aggressive boss kill loadout, use the safe banner + well loadout for boss room. This will extend the fight by a long time and you will have to deal with a lot of adds, two threshers, flame turrets and the boss sniping you from the platforms. The corner to the far right (under the boss pillar) is a good spot to bait adds and use supers from. Invis hunter should dunk the solar orbs. In the final phase the boss can aggro and chase you.
